Stupid event loop, interface modeled after Perl 5's AnyEvent.
Use perl6 --doc lib/MuEvent.pm for some basic documentation and tests
if you want more.

If you want some more-less real life example, example.pl shows a simple
application, which outputs stuff after 2 seconds, every 5 seconds,
and prints everything that is sent to port 6666 on the local machine.
It also prints "Nothing better to do" and sleeps for one second if it
currently has nothing better to do.
